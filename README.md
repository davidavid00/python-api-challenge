# python-api-challenge
This challenge was to test skills using APIs in Python.


The instructions were a little incomplete, so I placed both scripts within the WeatherPy folder, as it never mentioned creating a VacationPy folder. My private API keys have been hidden in the .gitignore file and the scripts will not run without your own keys.


The WeatherPy script found correlations between the latitude and the maximum temperature, however, there was little to no correlation to Humidity, Cloudiness or Wind Speed. This is covered more in depth in the python files themselves.


Finally for the VacationPy file, I was able to successfuly import the csv file, and select my optimal cities for a holiday. I was able to find a few suitable locations, mostly in Australia, Africa and South America. This would be a handy way to look for holiday destinations in the future.
